    content: `<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with new technologies and frameworks emerging regularly. As we move through 2024, several key trends are shaping the future of how we build and interact with web applications.</p>
    
    <h3>1. AI-Powered Development Tools</h3>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing how developers write code. From intelligent code completion to automated testing, AI tools are becoming indispensable in modern development workflows.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Web Assembly (WASM) Adoption</h3>
    <p>WebAssembly is enabling high-performance applications in the browser, allowing languages like Rust, C++, and Go to run at near-native speeds on the web.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h3>
    <p>PWAs continue to bridge the gap between web and native applications, offering app-like experiences with the reach and accessibility of the web.</p>
    
    <p>These trends represent just the beginning of what's possible in modern web development. Stay tuned for more exciting developments!</p>`,

    content: `<h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. It's not just a legal requirementâ€”it's a moral imperative and good business practice.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Principles of Accessible Design</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive</li>
      <li><strong>Operable:</strong> Interface components must be operable by all users</li>
      <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and UI operation must be understandable</li>
      <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Content must be robust enough for interpretation by assistive technologies</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Practical Implementation Tips</h3>
    <p>Start with semantic HTML, ensure proper color contrast, provide alternative text for images, and test with screen readers. Small changes can make a huge difference in user experience.</p>`,
